# 🎯 EXACT Steps for Your Current GTM Screen

## What You Have Right Now:
- A "Google Analytics: GA4 Event" tag (which is perfect!)
- Measurement ID: `G-4K6YY64XKN` ✅
- Need to fill in "Event Name" and choose a "Trigger"

## ✅ **Fill These Fields:**

### **1. Event Name Field**
In the empty "Event Name" field, enter: `page_view`

### **2. Triggering Section** 
Click "Choose a trigger to make this tag fire..."

### **3. Select Trigger**
- Look for "All Pages" in the list
- Click on it
- This will track every page visit

### **4. Save**
Click "Save" button

## 🚀 **That's It! You're Done With Basic Tracking**

Your tag will now:
- ✅ Send data to Google Analytics (`G-4K6YY64XKN`)
- ✅ Track page views (`page_view` event)
- ✅ Fire on every page ("All Pages" trigger)

## 🧪 **Test It:**

1. **Save and Publish** your GTM container
2. **Visit your website**
3. **Go to Google Analytics** → Real-time reports
4. **You should see** page view data coming in

## 📈 **Add More Events Later:**

Once this basic one works, you can create more GA4 Event tags for:
- `purchase` (when someone buys)
- `view_item` (when someone views a product)
- `add_to_wishlist` (when someone adds to wishlist)

**But start with just this one page_view tag first!**

## 🚨 **If "All Pages" Trigger Doesn't Exist:**

Create it:
1. Click the "+" next to triggering
2. **Trigger Name:** "All Pages"
3. **Trigger Type:** "Page View"
4. **This trigger fires on:** "All Pages"
5. **Save**

---

**Don't overthink it - just get this one tag working first!**
